Down the road though, you will probably end up replacing most if not all of these tools for higher quality ones.  PSA: The wire stripper is so terrible in this set, pretend it isn't even there.My boyfriend had this set before he moved out, and I was looking for a similar replacement set.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find something with similar tools for less than $100 (or honestly at all).  The most useful part of this set for me was the wrenching screwdriver, which seems rarely to be sold in tool sets, and is often like $15 on its own.  I had also found some of these other tools to be useful, like the screwdriver bits, the box cutter, the hex keys, the pliers.  The measuring tape and level were nice additions.  So I decided to purchase this set again.  The hammer turned out to be very useful as well.  In both of the sets (his was sold under a different brand name but they were pretty much identical) the wire cutter is terrible and completely useless, and the measuring tape is tangibly low quality.

The battery, after a full charge, ran for 3.5 hours nonstop at lowest setting, and it woul have continued, had I not turned it off after wife complained how loud it is. 5 speed settings, at the fastest it\\'s high pitched and annoying. Has a useless light which you can turn on and off with button, but the light doesn\\'t cover work area as it\\'s blocked by the chuck. You can hear components banging around when you shake it up and down and side to side. Also, it gets hot right under the name label, because nobody bothered to engineer vent holes. The mini USB (yeah, 2000 called wants the interface back) cable is nice and decently long, white, so you can see it better in low light. The HARDELL unit has skinny haptic buttons, and the other has a tactile one - actual plastic piece - I noticed on some other reviews that the skinny button \"tape\" starts tp peel off as well as wears out over time - especially in high dust and grit environments - meaning, it\\'s not engineered to last.Did I mention it comes in a nice zip bag? Yeah, but that\\'s not my bag baby... Populo is quieter, smaller, doesn\\'t get as hot, doesn\\'t rattle, costs the same, and even though it doesn\\'t have a light and is only three speeds, for me at least, came on top.

      "Review:  {'rating': 0.0, 'title': '', 'content': \"this miter shear works well and is accurate as long as you're not trying to cut thin objects like coffee stirrers. I'm a diorama crafter and often work with thin dimensional wood and they slide right under the angle fence.  the platen is angled slightly down from the center where the blade cuts.  the fence goes straight out so there is an increasing gap the farther out you go.  But even where it starts in the center it's up a bit too high off the platen.  That said, I think I can find a fix by gluing on a piece of styrene sheet that will extend downward and parallel to the sloping platen.Again...that said:  The fact that you get 6 V5 steel blades is awesome.  The cuts are clean with only occasional fraying because the blade chops down into a groove, so it pushes out the last fibers of the cut into the groove, but I think I have a fix to for that too.

I am not a handy girl and have little experience on fixing things. It comes pretty much with every tools (I can't name them all. See product pictures). The one I used was the calibrator. I used it to make sure my furniture are all leveled. The other tools I used are the screw drivers for replacing my electronic device batteries and measuring tapes to measure a working desktop. The box also comes with the electric screw driver with manual book in it. The price is affordable and worth it to purchase. Everyone should keep a set at home for house repair and car maintenance. Instead of buying every tool separately, buy this whole set instead. You will save tons of money.\"}\n",

The 6 inch adjustable wrench is ideal for small jobs and tight spaces. It came with a box and everything was packed inside the box. It's very well-organized. It performs exactly as described. The price and mini cordless screwdriver are appealing features. The quality is excellent. It's fantastic.This is a 176-piece high quality tool kit includes a 3.6V cordless screwdriver and quick charger, hammer, tape measure, screwdriver bit set, SAE Metric allen wrench set, magnetic level, scissors, long nose plier, 4-piece precision screwdriver set, utility knife, adjustable wrench, putty knife scraper, and other tools.All tools are made of high-quality chrome vanadium steel that has been forged at high temperatures to achieve high strength, hardness, durability, and corrosion resistance.Overall, the tools are of high quality, and I especially like the cordless screwdriver. The case is sturdy, and the tools remain securely fastened.\"}\n",

I was really anxious to use this as my babies\\' nails were quite long.Understand that, while I never actually tried the item on my babes, I did turn it on & touch the spinny thingie with my finger & it slowed to barely a crawl and even stopped spinning completely, at the simplest touch. There is, IMO, no way it would have been able to file down, my pups\\', or any other pups\\' nails. And since there was no way it would work on my dogs\\' nails, I honestly couldn\\'t imagine it working on any buffing, cutting, etching or whatever job it was supposed to.

      "Review:  {'rating': 0.0, 'title': '', 'content': 'I don\\'t have much experience with this type of rotary tool- I always use a much heavier powerless drill for the same job such as sanding, drilling and polishing something small with steady and finesse hands.  Having a tool like this that you can hold like a pen, feels natural and easy, definitely a lot more precise comparing to a \"pistol-grip\" type power drill.Inserting a drill bit is very intuitive without reading the manual!  Press and hold the square button to unlocks the protective screw-on cover to insert a drill bit.  Unscrew this cover to reveal the bit holder, insert bit, screw the cover back on tight, ready to go.  This tool comes with many tool bits and burrs.  Do some homework on what bit head is best for your material- wood, plastic, metal, stones, ceramic, glass, etc...  The instruction sheet describes this a little bit, but educate yourself first.  PS- PLEASE make the font size in the instruction bigger, they\\'re like font 7 or 8, very tiny.Power on the drill by pressing the self-explanatory round button, press it again to change the speed/power.  The LED guide light powers on, and I used to high setting (18000 RPM) for my test.  I find the lower speeds too under-powered, in my opinion, perhaps more delicate materials require a softer bit head on a lower speed?  Like I said, I don\\'t have much experience with this type of tool.  I was able to carve and cut into a piece of veiny pine, but a bit hard to go through wood vein/grain.  Perhaps with a different bit I should be able to cut through with ease.  The area around the drill bit gets hot after about 20 minutes of continuous use, no on and off, continue on high speed.  This heat does not burn, and I wasn\\'t too concerned because all power tools will heat up after extensive period of operation.  After about 40 minutes of testing, the battery holds, I haven\\'t charged the drill since my test.Overall, I think this is a fun and very useful tool to have if you want to do light arts and crafts projects, and build small hobbies and toys.  Best part- very very affordable!'}\n",

      "Review:  {'rating': 0.0, 'title': '', 'content': 'The Aote-Pitt cordless rotary tool is well made and the motor is great.  The instructions are well written and easy to understand.

I also like that it is in a shape of a sharpie, so I can hold it like a pen for better precision when I am engraving  or etching.  The rechargeable battery is a great feature because it will save me money from buying disposable batteries and no need to mess with a power cord during use.  30-day money back warranty is great, but replacement warranty is only 90 days, so hope it will not break down after only 3 months'}\n",

Having a tool like this that you can hold like a pen, feels natural and easy, definitely a lot more precise comparing to a \"pistol-grip\" type power drill.Inserting a drill bit is very intuitive without reading the manual!  Press and hold the square button to unlocks the protective screw-on cover to insert a drill bit.  Unscrew this cover to reveal the bit holder, insert bit, screw the cover back on tight, ready to go.  This tool comes with many tool bits and burrs.  Do some homework on what bit head is best for your material- wood, plastic, metal, stones, ceramic, glass, etc...  The instruction sheet describes this a little bit, but educate yourself first.  PS- PLEASE make the font size in the instruction bigger, they\\'re like font 7 or 8, very tiny.Power on the drill by pressing the self-explanatory round button, press it again to change the speed/power.  The LED guide light powers on, and I used to high setting (18000 RPM) for my test.  I find the lower speeds too under-powered, in my opinion, perhaps more delicate materials require a softer bit head on a lower speed?  Like I said, I don\\'t have much experience with this type of tool.  I was able to carve and cut into a piece of veiny pine, but a bit hard to go through wood vein/grain.  Perhaps with a different bit I should be able to cut through with ease.  The area around the drill bit gets hot after about 20 minutes of continuous use, no on and off, continue on high speed.  This heat does not burn, and I wasn\\'t too concerned because all power tools will heat up after extensive period of operation.  After about 40 minutes of testing, the battery holds, I haven\\'t charged the drill since my test.Overall, I think this is a fun and very useful tool to have if you want to do light arts and crafts projects, and build small hobbies and toys.

Used the round sand paper thing’s on them. I used it on medium setting and it worked well for my need’s. I like that it’s small, light and being cordless is nice. Used it for about 15 minutes on medium and it was still going,It did get a little warm though. So a guess would be 20-30 minutes on medium. Tightening the tool was pretty easy.I paid $26 for it which wasn’t to bad. I like the tool assortment that came with it. Good for light to medium materials. Can’t comment on Longevity of the dremel or battery life. On the feel of Quality I would give it a7 out of 10, for the price it was.'}\n",

Statt mir also die Finger wund zu ziehen, habe ich den Haken dafür verwendet. Sehr praktisch.Das Messer bietet viel Funktionalität für einen fairen Preis. Ein Schraubenzieher Set kann es nicht ersetzen, aber ich wetter so einige Projekte können alleine mit dem Messer in die Tat umgesetzt werden.'}\n",
